Liri

This project was to emulate an application similar to a Siri, except this application takes in a strings to search by instead of a voice

In createing this nodeJs console application, I used the spotify Api, to make calls to  these the last two Apis I used axios. 

I also used the "Fs" package to append the respose data to a text file accordingly.

I utilized "process.argv" to obtain the proper index to for the search query and to have three different strings to use when calling thier respective functions which allows for the execution of the "spotify", "OMbd" and "bands in town" functions
